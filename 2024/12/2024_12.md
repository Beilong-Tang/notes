### Bug Fix
- [x] I just realized that the funcodec checkpoint `audio_codec-encodec-zh_en-general-16k-nq32ds640-pytorch` is not the correct one. I am not sure what caused this issue; I should be careful with the file naming and saving.

- I ran the inference on libri2mix and it seems quite good, but the audio sounds a bit off. 
- [ ] Make the audio normailzation before inference.
- [ ] Add DNSMOS and WER test and see results. 
- [ ] Make the audio normalization before training and retrain it.
- [ ] Conduct Model on Challenge dataset.
