TODO from last month:

## 2024 Dec 31
- I ran the inference on libri2mix and it seems quite good, but the audio sounds a bit off. 
- [ ] Make the audio normailzation before inference.
- [ ] Add DNSMOS and WER, and SpkSim and see results. 
- [ ] Make the audio normalization before training and retrain it.
- [ ] Conduct Model on Challenge dataset.



## 2025 Jan 1

- [ ] [Laura_GPT_SE] run an experiment that normalizes audio first. Make it `config_v1.yaml`. After running it, rm the config before.
