TODO from last month:

## 2024 Dec 31
- ~~I ran the inference on libri2mix and it seems quite good, but the audio sounds a bit off.~~ (This is due to normalization issues, I added normalization at the end and it seems good). 
- ~~[] Make the audio normailzation before inference.~~ (Same as above).
- [ ] Add DNSMOS and WER, and SpkSim and see results. 
- ~~[ ] Make the audio normalization before training and retrain it.~~ (Not necessary as some layers will make normalization first).
- [ ] Conduct Model on Challenge dataset.



## 2025 Jan 1

- ~~[ ] [Laura_GPT_SE] run an experiment that normalizes audio first. Make it `config_v1.yaml`. After running it, rm the config before.~~
- [x] Change DNSMOS to have the model ckpt to be one of the arguments; so that I can move the script anywhere.
- [ ] Change WER to use Large Model.
